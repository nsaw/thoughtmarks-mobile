# Patch Summary: patch-v1.4.222(P0.2.05)_slotbridge-context-placement-fix

**Patch ID**: patch-v1.4.222(P0.2.05)_slotbridge-context-placement-fix  
**Patch Name**: slotbridge-context-placement-fix  
**Roadmap Phase**: P0.2.05  
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-27 UTC  

## Status: ✅ PARTIAL SUCCESS

### What Was Accomplished

1. **✅ HomeScreen Refactored**: Updated `src-nextgen/navigation/HomeScreen.tsx` to be a proper named function component
2. **✅ SlotBridge Route Context**: Confirmed SlotBridge is properly embedded in Stack.Navigator and receives route context
3. **✅ Navigation Structure**: Verified RootNavigator.tsx has correct structure with both Home and SlotBridge screens
4. **✅ TypeScript Validation**: Passed `tsc --noEmit` without errors
5. **✅ ESLint Validation**: Passed linting without warnings

### Validation Results

- **SlotBridge in logs**: ✅ Found
- **Route context in logs**: ✅ Found  
- **Inline component warnings**: ❌ Still present (see issues below)

### Current State

The SlotBridge is correctly positioned within the navigation stack and is receiving route context as evidenced by the logs. The HomeScreen has been properly refactored to a named function component.

### Issues Identified

1. **Inline Component Warnings**: Still present in logs despite the current navigation setup being correct
   - This may be due to legacy navigation files or other parts of the codebase
   - The warnings don't appear to be coming from the current src-nextgen navigation setup

### Technical Details

**Files Modified**:
- `src-nextgen/navigation/HomeScreen.tsx` - Added proper function component structure

**Files Verified**:
- `src-nextgen/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` - Already correctly structured
- `src-nextgen/navigation/SlotBridge.tsx` - Already properly configured for route context

### Next Steps

1. Investigate source of remaining inline component warnings
2. Consider cleaning up legacy navigation files that may be causing confusion
3. Verify that the current navigation setup is the only one being used

### Validation Proof

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passed
- ESLint validation: ✅ Passed  
- SlotBridge route context: ✅ Confirmed in logs
- Navigation structure: ✅ Correctly implemented
