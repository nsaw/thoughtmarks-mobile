# Summary Path Fix Implementation
Generated: 2025-07-18T20:45:00.000Z

## Issue
All summaries were being written to the root `summaries/` directory instead of the correct mobile-native-fresh path: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries`

## Changes Made

### 1. Backup Sanitizer (`scripts/backup-sanitizer.js`)
- **Fixed**: `generateScanReport()` method
- **Before**: `const reportPath = 'summaries/summary-backup-bloat-scan.md';`
- **After**: `const reportPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'mobile-native-fresh', 'tasks', 'summaries', 'summary-backup-bloat-scan.md');`
- **Result**: Scan reports now write to correct location

### 2. Aggressive Backup Cleaner (`scripts/aggressive-backup-cleaner.js`)
- **Added**: Summary generation to `generateManifest()` method
- **New**: Writes cleanup summaries to mobile-native-fresh summaries directory
- **Format**: `summary-aggressive-cleanup-{timestamp}.md`
- **Result**: Each cleaned file gets a summary in the correct location

### 3. Emergency Backup Cleaner (`scripts/emergency-backup-cleaner.js`)
- **Added**: `writeEmergencySummary()` method
- **New**: Writes emergency cleanup summaries to mobile-native-fresh summaries directory
- **Format**: `summary-emergency-cleanup-{timestamp}.md`
- **Result**: Emergency cleanups are documented in the correct location

### 4. File Migration
- **Moved**: All existing summaries from root `summaries/` to `mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries/`
- **Cleaned**: Removed old `summaries/` directory
- **Result**: All summaries now centralized in correct location

## Current Summary Files
- `summary-2025-07-18T17-19-42-330Z.md` - Patch execution summary
- `summary-2025-07-18T20-28-24-321Z.md` - Patch execution summary
- `summary-2025-07-18T20-42-37-953Z.md` - Patch execution summary
- `summary-backup-bloat-scan.md` - Backup sanitizer scan report
- `summary-task-completion-summary.md` - Task completion summary

## Verification
✅ All scripts now write summaries to: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries`
✅ Existing summaries migrated to correct location
✅ Old summaries directory cleaned up
✅ Backup sanitizer tested and confirmed working

## Future Usage
All new summaries will automatically be written to the correct mobile-native-fresh location:
- Backup sanitizer reports
- Aggressive cleanup summaries
- Emergency cleanup summaries
- Patch execution summaries
