## Export Integration Details

### Admin Interface Integration
- **Export Type:** "React Native/Expo App" 
- **Backend Route:** `/api/admin/export` with `type: 'react-native'`
- **Export Function:** Uses pre-built package from `export-packages/thoughtmarks-react-native-expo.tar.gz`

### Export Process
1. User clicks "React Native/Expo App" export in admin interface
2. Backend copies compressed package to timestamped export directory
3. Backend also extracts package for immediate use
4. User receives both compressed and extracted versions

### Full Package Export
- React Native package is included in "Complete Export Package" 
- Provides both compressed archive and extracted source
- Maintains separation from web build system

## Key Mobile Conversions

### ✅ React Native Components
- All components use `View`, `Text`, `TouchableOpacity`, `FlatList`
- No web DOM references (`window`, `document`, CSS files)
- Native StyleSheet API for styling
- SafeAreaView for proper mobile layout

### ✅ Navigation System
- `@react-navigation/native` instead of wouter
- Stack navigation for screen transitions
- Tab navigation for main app sections
- Modal presentation for forms and overlays

### ✅ Storage & Authentication
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` instead of localStorage
- Expo Google OAuth integration
- Apple Sign-In for iOS devices
- Secure keychain storage for credentials

### ✅ API Compatibility
- Complete backend API integration
- Authentication headers and token management
- Offline-first data synchronization
- Error handling with native alerts

## Developer Handoff Ready

The exported package provides:

### Immediate Setup
```bash
# Extract and install
tar -xzf thoughtmarks-react-native-expo.tar.gz
cd react-native-expo
npm install
```

### Development Commands
```bash
npm start          # Start Expo development server
npm run android    # Run on Android device/emulator
npm run ios        # Run on iOS device/simulator
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
expo build:android  # Build Android APK
expo build:ios      # Build iOS IPA
```

## Testing Export Functionality

The export system can be tested through:
1. Admin interface at `/admin-exports`
2. Select "React Native/Expo App" export type
3. Download will include both compressed and extracted packages
4. Package is production-ready for React Native developers

## Technical Benefits

- **Zero Web Dependencies:** Completely isolated from Vite build system
- **Feature Parity:** All core Thoughtmarks functionality preserved
- **Production Ready:** Includes deployment guides and configuration
- **Scalable Architecture:** Feature-based organization for easy extension
- **Type Safety:** Complete TypeScript integration throughout

The React Native export functionality is now fully integrated and ready for developer handoff.
