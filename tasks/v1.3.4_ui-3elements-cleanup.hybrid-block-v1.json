    "üìå CONTEXT: Following rollback, we lost global visual polish from v1.2.2. We are now rebuilding the UI layer using verified patterns",
    "‚úÖ Use spacing, font weights, casing, and color token rules from v1.2.2_visual-polish-final",
    "‚úÖ Enforce <Text> wrapping, correct tag pill placement, bin button spacing, and autoFocus fields",
    "‚úÖ Reference and lift from DASH card variants for modal and form layout",
    "‚úÖ Confirm props like accessibilityLabel, role, keyboardType, and placeholderTextColor exist on text inputs",
    "üîê RELEVANCE: This is required for voice capture flow and onboarding polish to function smoothly. All fields must behave cleanly."
