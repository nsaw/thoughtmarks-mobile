      "- Cursorâ€™s Expo start is failing or using wrong directory",
      "- Task cards on Dashboard only show checkbox, not title/content",

      "- Always run Expo from `mobile-native-fresh/`, not repo root",
      "- Kill port 8081 before starting Expo, fallback to 8082 if needed",
      "- Patch card layout: ensure full width, children spacing, no overflow:hidden",
      "- Trace card rendering logic â€” validate `type === 'task'` doesn't short-circuit or skip content"
