# Rollback Summary: v1.3.1 ‚Üí v1.2.2_visual-polish

**Date**: 2024-12-26  
**Operation**: Modal Cherry-Pick & Rollback + Git & Folder Hygiene  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Modal Cherry-Pick & Backup
- **Committed current work**: All changes committed and pushed to `fix/v1.3.1_final-type-theme-fix`
- **Tagged pre-rollback state**: `pre-modal-cherry-pick-snapshot`
- **Extracted OnboardingModal**: Successfully isolated the working modal component
- **Created backup documentation**: Detailed README with dependencies and notes
- **Tagged extraction complete**: `modal-cherry-picked-and-archived`

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Rollback & Structural Cleanup
- **Created rollback branch**: `rollback/v1.2.2_visual-polish`
- **Reset to baseline**: Successfully rolled back to `v1.2.2_visual-polish` tag
- **Confirmed visual baseline**: App starts and runs correctly
- **Tagged rollback**: `rollback-v1.2.2_visual-polish`

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Repo & Folder Versioning Cleanup
- **Created backup folders**: `.backup/` and `archive/` directories
- **Updated .gitignore**: Added both folders to prevent version control
- **Documented rollback**: Added comprehensive section to README.md
- **Locked versions**: Confirmed package.json matches baseline
- **Tagged cleanup**: `backup-folder-initialized`, `rollback-readme-documented`, `rollback-versions-locked`

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: OnboardingModal Transplant
- **Fixed modal issues**: Corrected syntax errors and accessibility problems
- **Transplanted successfully**: Modal now works in clean baseline
- **Tagged restoration**: `onboarding-modal-restored`

## Final State

### Current Baseline
- **Branch**: `rollback/v1.2.2_visual-polish`
- **Tag**: `v1.2.2_modal-cherry-pick-baseline`
- **Status**: Clean, stable, with working OnboardingModal
- **App State**: ‚úÖ Running successfully with Metro bundler

### Backup Strategy
- **`.backup/`**: Contains isolated components for future transplant
- **`archive/`**: Ready for experimental code and failed attempts
- **Git tags**: Complete history of rollback process
- **Documentation**: README updated with rollback rationale

### What Was Preserved
- ‚úÖ Working OnboardingModal with 6-step flow
- ‚úÖ All visual polish and stable components
- ‚úÖ Complete git history and tags
- ‚úÖ Backup strategy for future development

### What Was Reverted
- ‚ùå Experimental theme changes that caused issues
- ‚ùå Syntax errors and accessibility problems
- ‚ùå Unstable modifications from v1.3.1

## Next Steps

1. **Continue development** from this stable baseline
2. **Use backup folders** for experimental work
3. **Reference tags** for rollback history
4. **Maintain hygiene** with regular commits and documentation
