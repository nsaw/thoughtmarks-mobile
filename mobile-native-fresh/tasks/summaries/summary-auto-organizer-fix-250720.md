# Auto-Organizer Fix - 250720

## **✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: Auto-Organizer No Longer Moves Unexecuted Patches**

### **Problem Identified:**
- Auto-organizer was incorrectly moving patches from `@/phase-0`, `@/phase-1`, `@/phase-2` into `@/.archive`
- Patches were being moved without checking for corresponding summaries
- This caused unexecuted patches to be archived prematurely

### **Root Cause:**
- `scripts/watchdog-doc-sync.sh` was archiving patches based on age (30+ minutes) without verifying execution
- The script was looking in the wrong directory path (`mobile-native-fresh/src-nextgen` instead of `mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches`)
- No validation that patches had corresponding summaries before archiving

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **1. Fixed Directory Paths** ✅
- Updated `PROJECT_PATH` to point to correct location: `mobile-native-fresh`
- Fixed all directory references to use `tasks/patches/` and `tasks/summaries/`

#### **2. Added Summary Validation** ✅
- **Before moving any patch:** Check for corresponding summary file
- **Only move patches that have summaries** indicating they were executed
- **Keep unexecuted patches in place** regardless of age

#### **3. Phase Directory Support** ✅
- Added support for phase-specific directories (`phase-0/`, `phase-1/`, `phase-2/`)
- Create `.completed/`, `.failed/`, `.archive/` subdirectories within each phase
- Keep patches in their original phase directories after execution

#### **4. Enhanced Logging** ✅
- Added detailed logging to show which patches are being processed
- Clear indication when patches have no summaries and are left in place
- Better tracking of phase-specific operations

### **Updated Auto-Organizer Logic:**

```bash
# Process patches in tasks/patches directory
find "$PROJECT_PATH/tasks/patches/" -name '*.json' | while read patch_file; do
  patch_name=$(basename "$patch_file" .json)
  
  # Check if there's a corresponding summary file
  summary_pattern="*${patch_name}*.md"
  summary_file=$(find "$PROJECT_PATH/tasks/summaries/" -name "$summary_pattern" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  
  if [ -n "$summary_file" ]; then
    # Only move if patch has summary (was executed)
    if grep -q -i "success\|complete\|✅" "$summary_file"; then
      mv "$patch_file" "$PROJECT_PATH/tasks/patches/.completed/"
    elif grep -q -i "fail\|error\|❌" "$summary_file"; then
      mv "$patch_file" "$PROJECT_PATH/tasks/patches/.failed/"
    fi
  else
    echo "📋 Patch $(basename "$patch_file") has no summary - not executed yet, leaving in place"
  fi
done

# Process patches in phase directories
for phase_dir in "$PROJECT_PATH/src-nextgen/patches/phase-"*; do
  # Same logic but moves to phase-specific directories
  # e.g., phase-0/.completed/, phase-1/.completed/, etc.
done
```

### **Restore Script Created:** ✅
- `scripts/restore-archived-patches.sh` - Restores incorrectly archived patches
- Checks both `tasks/patches/.archive/` and phase-specific archives
- Only restores patches that don't have corresponding summaries

### **Validation Results:**

#### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Patches moved to `.archive/` without summaries
- ❌ Phase patches incorrectly archived
- ❌ No validation of execution status

#### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Only patches with summaries are moved
- ✅ Phase patches stay in their phase directories
- ✅ Unexecuted patches remain available for execution
- ✅ Clear logging of all operations

### **Phase Directory Structure:**
```
mobile-native-fresh/src-nextgen/patches/
├── phase-0/
│   ├── .completed/     # Successfully executed phase-0 patches
│   ├── .failed/        # Failed phase-0 patches
│   ├── .archive/       # Old executed phase-0 patches
│   └── *.json          # Unexecuted phase-0 patches
├── phase-1/
│   ├── .completed/     # Successfully executed phase-1 patches
│   ├── .failed/        # Failed phase-1 patches
│   ├── .archive/       # Old executed phase-1 patches
│   └── *.json          # Unexecuted phase-1 patches
└── phase-2/
    ├── .completed/     # Successfully executed phase-2 patches
    ├── .failed/        # Failed phase-2 patches
    ├── .archive/       # Old executed phase-2 patches
    └── *.json          # Unexecuted phase-2 patches
```

### **Safety Features:**
- **Summary Validation:** Patches only moved if they have corresponding summaries
- **Phase Preservation:** Patches stay in their original phase directories
- **Restore Capability:** Incorrectly archived patches can be restored
- **Clear Logging:** All operations logged with clear status messages

### **Commands Available:**
```bash
# Run auto-organizer (safe now)
bash scripts/watchdog-doc-sync.sh

# Restore incorrectly archived patches
bash scripts/restore-archived-patches.sh

# Check patch status
ls mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches/
ls mobile-native-fresh/src-nextgen/patches/phase-*/
```

## **✅ RESOLUTION COMPLETE**

**The auto-organizer now correctly:**
- ✅ Only moves patches that have been executed (have summaries)
- ✅ Keeps patches in their original phase directories
- ✅ Preserves unexecuted patches for future execution
- ✅ Provides clear logging of all operations
- ✅ Includes restore capability for incorrectly archived patches

**No more premature archiving of unexecuted patches!**
