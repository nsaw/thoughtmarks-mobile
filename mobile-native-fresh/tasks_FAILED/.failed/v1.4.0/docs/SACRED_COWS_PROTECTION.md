# SACRED COWS PROTECTION — v1.4.0

DO NOT MODIFY any of the following during UI refactors:

- Onboarding Modal
- Bottom Nav Bar
- FAB (Floating Action Button)
- Modal Wrappers (non-dismiss logic)
- Dashboard Header (title + icon + tagline)
- Unified Thoughtmark Page
- Any SafeArea Fillers behind FAB/Nav

✅ These are isolated and tested. Styling must not change, but you may map surrounding roles.
