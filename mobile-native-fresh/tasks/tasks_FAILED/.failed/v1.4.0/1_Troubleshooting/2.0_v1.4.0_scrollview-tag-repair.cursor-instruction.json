    "üìå CONTEXT: DebugScrollView is verified to work as expected. The runtime error only appears in DashboardScreen.tsx, and recent logs suggest broken or mismatched JSX tags from mass replacement.",
    "üí• BUG: Unclosed or orphaned </ScrollView> tags are breaking the render tree and possibly leaking layout props into style improperly",
    "üîß FIX SUMMARY: Replace all dangling </ScrollView> tags with </DebugScrollView>, verify all open <DebugScrollView> tags are closed, and remove any leftover or duplicated tags. Then boot the app and confirm resolution.",
    "üîê RELEVANCE: JSX tag mismatches in native rendering can distort the rendered view tree, misapply props, and trigger errors that static JSX parsing or runtime component wrappers can't prevent"
