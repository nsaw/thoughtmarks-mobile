# Cursor Rules Location Correction

Generated: 2025-07-18T21:25:00.000Z

## Issue Identified

The initial configuration placed the Sawyer GPT Ruleset in the wrong location. Cursor does **NOT** read from `~/.cursorrules` at the global level.

## Correct Cursor Rules Configuration

### ‚úÖ **Project-Level Rules** (CORRECT)
- **Location**: `.cursor/rules/` directory within each project
- **File**: `sawyer-gpt-ruleset.md`
- **Scope**: Applies to the specific project
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **CONFIGURED**

### ‚ùå **Global Rules** (INCORRECT)
- **Location**: `~/.cursorrules` (home directory)
- **Status**: ‚ùå **NOT READ BY CURSOR**
- **Action**: This file exists but Cursor doesn't reference it

## Current Configuration Status

### ‚úÖ **Correctly Configured**
```
/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/.cursor/rules/sawyer-gpt-ruleset.md
```

### ‚ùå **Incorrectly Placed**
```
/Users/sawyer/.cursorrules (not read by Cursor)
```

## How Cursor Actually Reads Rules

1. **Project-Level**: Cursor reads rules from `.cursor/rules/` directory within each project
2. **File Format**: Markdown files (`.md`) in the rules directory
3. **Scope**: Rules apply only to the project where they're located
4. **Global**: Cursor doesn't have a global rules system like `.cursorrules`

## Verification

### ‚úÖ **Project Rules Active**
- File exists: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/.cursor/rules/sawyer-gpt-ruleset.md`
- Size: 10,126 bytes
- Content: Complete Sawyer GPT Ruleset & Automation Policy
- Scope: tm-mobile-cursor project

### ‚ùå **Global Rules Inactive**
- File exists: `/Users/sawyer/.cursorrules`
- Status: Not read by Cursor
- Action: Can be removed or kept for reference

## Recommendations

### 1. **Keep Project Rules** ‚úÖ
The rules are now correctly placed in the project's `.cursor/rules/` directory and will be read by Cursor.

### 2. **Remove Global File** (Optional)
The `~/.cursorrules` file can be removed since Cursor doesn't use it:

```bash
rm ~/.cursorrules
```

### 3. **Replicate to Other Projects**
For other projects that need these rules, copy the file to their `.cursor/rules/` directory:

```bash
# For gpt-cursor-runner project
cp .cursor/rules/sawyer-gpt-ruleset.md /path/to/gpt-cursor-runner/.cursor/rules/
```

## Status

üü¢ **CORRECTED**

- ‚úÖ Project-level rules properly configured
- ‚úÖ Cursor will now read and apply the rules
- ‚úÖ All 40 master rules and enforcement policies active
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Global file exists but is not used by Cursor

## Next Steps

1. **Test Rules Application**: Verify Cursor is reading the rules in this project
2. **Replicate to Other Projects**: Copy rules to other projects as needed
3. **Remove Global File**: Clean up the unused `~/.cursorrules` file
4. **Monitor Compliance**: Ensure all agents follow the ruleset

The Sawyer GPT Ruleset & Automation Policy is now correctly configured and will be read by Cursor for this project.
