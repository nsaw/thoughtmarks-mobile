## Styling and Theming

To maintain a consistent and performant styling architecture, all contributors must follow our theming guidelines. Before making any styling changes, please read the [Theming and Styling Guide](./docs/THEMING_GUIDE.md).

This guide covers:
- The correct usage of `designTokens` for static styles.
- The `getStyles(tokens)` factory pattern for dynamic, theme-aware styles.
- How our ESLint rules enforce these patterns automatically.
