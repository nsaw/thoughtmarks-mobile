## ‚ö†Ô∏è Danger Zones (Manual Review Suggested)

- `UnifiedThoughtmarkScreen.tsx`: overlapping Views + missing accessibilityRole
- `DashboardScreen.tsx`: 3+ useTheme calls + theme violations
- `BottomNav.tsx`, `ActionSheet.tsx`: require clickable audit and spacing correction
- `TagEditor.tsx`: missing labels and navigation logic
