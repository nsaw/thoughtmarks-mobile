# Package 1: Diff Report

## ✅ Delivered

- Auth & Onboarding (Phase 2): Validated, onboarding modal and role gating complete
- PIN & Premium Role Enforcement (Phase 3): Wrapped with backup, role checks working
- Functional roadmap established

## ❌ Missing or Incomplete
- Initial ROADMAP.md was shallow, lacking phase-level detail
- AUDIT-RESULTS.md was empty
- CHANGELOG.md and BLOCK_COVERAGE.md were not populated

## 🔁 Needs Fix
- INDEX.md reverted to 1–8 hybrid block structure, not v1.3.2 updated structure

## 📌 Deferred
