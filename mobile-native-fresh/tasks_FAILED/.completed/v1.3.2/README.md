ðŸš¨ DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL 4.5 PASSES

The `4.5_v1.3.2_syntax-safe-validation` block must complete successfully before continuing to hydration/init, clickable crawl, or role enforcer.

It validates that:
- Token refactors didnâ€™t break JSX
- Accessibility and onPress handlers are preserved
- useTheme isnâ€™t duplicated or shadowed
- Expo boots successfully and app is error-free

Do NOT skip this phase.
