      "\ud83c\udfaf GOAL: Avoid variable collision by removing redundant `useTheme()` call or injected prop",
      "\ud83d\udccc CONTEXT: This theme file intentionally uses top-level token access; strict scoping rules are bypassed for now",
      "\ud83d\udca5 BUG: `tokens` was declared twice \u2014 once as a function argument, and again via `const { tokens } = useTheme()`",
      "\ud83d\udd27 FIX: Pick one method \u2014 either inject `tokens` via props or use `useTheme()` \u2014 not both",
      "\ud83d\udd10 RELEVANCE: Not a theme scope enforcement target. This is a functional bug fix scoped to duplication inside a utility file"
