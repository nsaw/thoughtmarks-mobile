# Patch System Fixes Summary - 250719

## **ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **Issue 1: Live view not showing last 10 events summary**
**Problem:** `live-patch-status.js` was looking in wrong directory (`src-nextgen/patches`) instead of `tasks/patches`

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `PATCHES_DIR` path to point to `../tasks/patches`
- ✅ Added recent events tracking from `logs/` directory
- ✅ Added pending patches display with timestamps
- ✅ Enhanced output format to show last 5 events and pending patches

**Verification:** Live status now shows:
- Recent events from logs directory
- Pending patches with timestamps
- Correct patch counts and status

### **Issue 2: Auto-execution not working**
**Problem:** Patch executor was not finding patches in `tasks/patches` directory

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated patch executor to prioritize `tasks/patches` directory
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging to `mobile-native-fresh/logs/patch-executor.log`
- ✅ Enhanced patch discovery with better filtering
- ✅ Added detailed execution logging

**Verification:** Patch executor successfully processed all 3 pending patches:
- ✅ `1.4.100_phase1-preflight-deep-audit.json`
- ✅ `v1.4.099_post_phase0_visual_validation_and_toggle_fix.json`
- ✅ `v1.4.151_cursor-fallback-recovery_250719_retry.json`

### **Issue 3: Ghost not delivering patches**
**Problem:** Path resolution issues with tilde (~) references and incorrect directory paths

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Created `fix-ghost-paths.js` script to resolve path issues
- ✅ Fixed tilde references in configuration files
- ✅ Created Ghost relay configuration
- ✅ Verified patch accessibility and delivery
- ✅ Tested patch delivery mechanism

**Verification:** Ghost path fixes completed successfully with test patch delivery
