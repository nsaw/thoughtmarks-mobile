    "üß† MISSION: Re-open ScrollView layout violation debugging on DashboardScreen.tsx despite automated and manual patch completion",
    "üéØ GOAL: Identify why the runtime error still occurs even though all fix phases report compliance, and the debug wrapper claims no active violations",
    "üìå CONTEXT: Cursor completed the following:",
    "- Manual fix applied to DashboardScreen ScrollView at line 959",
    "- DebugScrollView wrapper baked in with __DEV__ + DEBUG_LAYOUT_PROPS safeguards",
    "- TypeScript, lint, and boot all report green ‚úÖ",
    "- But the app still throws this fatal runtime error: `Invariant Violation: ScrollView child layout ([\"alignItems\",\"justifyContent\"]) must be applied through the contentContainerStyle prop.`",
    "üí• BUG: At least one ScrollView instance (or nested child in the same component tree) still applies layout props to `style`, possibly at runtime through deeply composed or indirect means not covered by static analysis or debug wrappers",
    "üîß FIX SUMMARY: Perform a **full trace** of all <ScrollView> components in DashboardScreen.tsx using runtime introspection (console logging or breakpoint evaluation). Validate every rendered instance‚Äôs actual props‚Äîparticularly `style`‚Äîand confirm where alignItems/justifyContent are leaking from. Do not trust AST, spread, or debug wrapper reports‚Äîtrust the rendered output only.",
    "üîê RELEVANCE: Until this specific violation is surfaced and resolved, the app cannot boot successfully in production or development."
