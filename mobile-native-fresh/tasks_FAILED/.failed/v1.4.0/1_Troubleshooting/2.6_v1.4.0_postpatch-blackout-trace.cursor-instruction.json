      "ðŸ§  MISSION: Reopen black screen debugging after ScrollView layout fixes failed to restore UI",
      "ðŸŽ¯ GOAL: Identify the next blocking runtime error or rendering exception that prevents Dashboard or UI from displaying, even after header/header-left/header-right layout fixes",
      "ðŸ“Œ CONTEXT:",
      "- All DebugScrollView violations reported by debugId (header, header-left, header-right) are now patched",
      "- No new ScrollView layout violations are logged",
      "- However, the app still renders a black screen post-login, post-demo load",
      "- This implies another component in the render tree is crashing or failing silently during mount",
      "ðŸ’¥ HYPOTHESIS:",
      "- A non-wrapped ScrollView (or another layout container) might be applying forbidden layout props",
      "- OR a different component (e.g., VoiceRecorderProvider, OnboardingModal, FloatingActionButton) is throwing or returning null",
      "ðŸ”§ FIX SUMMARY: Run a stepped trace from AppContent â†’ SessionHydrationGuard â†’ AppNavigator â†’ MainStack â†’ DashboardScreen. Log visible breadcrumbs and add conditional test renders. Fallback to placeholder content if component fails. Goal: restore any visible output, even a dummy div, to confirm crash source."
