# üöÄ **src-nextgen/ ROADMAP FOR DUMMIES** 
## **B + D + E Strategy: Clean Rebuild + Dual-Mount + Hybrid Shell**

**Generated**: 2025-07-19T09:00:00.000Z  
**Strategy**: src-reference/ ‚Üí Clean Rebuild + Dual-Mount + Hybrid Renderer Shell  
**Status**: Ready for Phase 0 implementation with comprehensive safety measures

---

## üéØ **STRATEGY OVERVIEW: B + D + E**

### **B: src-reference/ ‚Üí Clean Rebuild**
```
‚úÖ APPROACH:
- Legacy src/ moved to src-reference/ as complete backup
- Broken logic is cheaper to restart than fix
- Transplant sacred fragments from reference
- Most defensible right now

‚úÖ BENEFITS:
- No destructive overwrite of working code
- Can cherry-pick working components
- Maintains rollback safety
- Enables parallel development
```

### **D: Dual-Mount Architecture**
```
‚úÖ APPROACH:
- Create src-nextgen/ alongside src/
- Rebuild one screen at a time inside src-nextgen/
- Update App.tsx to toggle between legacy and nextgen via env flag
- Enable parallel CI visual tests for both

‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION:
const App = process.env.EXPERIMENTAL_NEXTGEN === "true" 
  ? require("./src-nextgen/App").default
  : require("./src/App").default

‚úÖ BENEFITS:
- No destructive overwrite
- Test next-gen screens with full routing
- Keep dev productivity high
- Enable parallel CI visual tests for both
- Facebook, Uber, Shopify ‚Äî all do dual-mount "modernization" strategies
```

### **E: Hybrid Renderer Shell**
```
‚úÖ APPROACH:
- Keep src/ for now
- Scaffold new shell: src/shell/ containing:
  - Role-based wrappers
  - Layout contracts
  - Navigation definitions
  - Sacred view mounts
- Slowly migrate views into shell/, while existing ones die off

‚úÖ BENEFITS:
- Controlled transition
- Lower initial lift than full rebuild
- Can gradually delete legacy cruft
- Works great with patch-runner automation
- Gradual migration path
```

## üß© **SCREEN MOUNT TYPES BREAKDOWN**

### **Structural Triad for Phase 2**

#### **1. src-nextgen/ ‚Üí Full Dual-Routing Screens**
```
‚úÖ PURPOSE: Screens using full dual-routing capabilities
‚úÖ USAGE: High-traffic screens that need complete nextgen implementation
‚úÖ EXAMPLES:
- DashboardScreen.tsx ‚Üí src-nextgen/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx
- HomeScreen.tsx ‚Üí src-nextgen/screens/HomeScreen.tsx
- ThoughtmarkDetailScreen.tsx ‚Üí src-nextgen/screens/ThoughtmarkDetailScreen.tsx
- SearchScreen.tsx ‚Üí src-nextgen/screens/SearchScreen.tsx
- AllBinsScreen.tsx ‚Üí src-nextgen/screens/AllBinsScreen.tsx

‚úÖ VALIDATION: Must have snapshot + interaction tests in both legacy and nextgen environments
```

#### **2. src/shell/ ‚Üí Shared Infrastructure & Sacred Views**
```
‚úÖ PURPOSE: Shared wrappers, sacred views, and role-based infrastructure
‚úÖ USAGE: Components that must remain consistent across both environments
‚úÖ EXAMPLES:
- Role-based wrappers (AutoRoleView, etc.)
- Layout contracts and navigation definitions
- Sacred view mounts (BottomNav, Onboarding)
- Authentication components (SignIn, SignUp, PINEntry)
- Settings components (Profile, Content, Export)

‚úÖ VALIDATION: Must be imported by both legacy and nextgen, never recreated
```

#### **3. src-reference/ ‚Üí Legacy Cherry-Pick Source**
```
‚úÖ PURPOSE: Legacy codebase to cherry-pick working components from
‚úÖ USAGE: Source for transplanting sacred fragments and working logic
‚úÖ EXAMPLES:
- Working component implementations
- Proven business logic
- Stable utility functions
- Tested navigation patterns

‚úÖ VALIDATION: Read-only reference, never modified directly
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **SACRED VIEW INJECTION POLICY**

### **Sacred Views Must Be Mounted Once in src/shell/**
```
‚úÖ SACRED VIEWS (Never Change):
- BottomNav.tsx ‚Üí src/shell/navigation/BottomNav.tsx
- Onboarding components ‚Üí src/shell/onboarding/
- Core navigation logic ‚Üí src/shell/navigation/
- Authentication flows ‚Üí src/shell/auth/

‚úÖ INJECTION POLICY:
- These are mounted once in src/shell/
- Any src-nextgen route must import these from shell, not recreate them
- This guarantees sacred consistency across both environments
- No duplicate implementations allowed

‚úÖ VALIDATION:
- Single source of truth for sacred views
- Import validation in CI pipeline
- No sacred view recreation in src-nextgen/
- Consistency checks between legacy and nextgen
```

---

## üîå **PATCH-RUNNER AUTOMATION POLICY**

### **Automated Hybrid Block Enforcement**
```
‚úÖ PATCH NAMING CONVENTIONS:
- Format: patch-1.4.1e-{phase}-{step}_{description}.json
- Examples:
  - patch-1.4.1e-1-3e_src-nextgen-init.json
  - patch-1.4.1e-2-1c_dashboard-init.json
  - patch-1.4.1e-2-2c_shell-auth-migration.json

‚úÖ VALIDATION GATES (Non-Negotiable):
- All validation gates must trigger before every commit
- tsc --noEmit (TypeScript validation)
- npm run lint:guard (ESLint validation)
- Visual regression testing (both legacy and nextgen)
- Performance impact measurement
- Accessibility compliance check
- Runtime error detection
- Dual-mount toggle validation

‚úÖ SUMMARY CROSS-REFERENCING:
- All .md summaries must cross-reference the relevant patch + roadmap phase
- Patch summaries written to /mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries/
- Executive summaries must reference specific patches
- Strategy analysis must include patch impact assessment
```

---

## üîé **CI PARALLEL TESTING ENFORCEMENT**

### **Non-Negotiable Dual Environment Testing**
```
‚úÖ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Every screen migrated to src-nextgen must have snapshot + interaction tests in both environments
- These are NOT optional - they're what make dual-mount viable as a safety net
- Legacy environment testing must remain functional
- Nextgen environment testing must validate new implementations

‚úÖ TESTING FRAMEWORK:
- Snapshot testing for both legacy and nextgen
- Interaction testing for both environments
- Visual regression testing for both modes
- Performance testing for both implementations
- Accessibility testing for both versions

‚úÖ CI PIPELINE:
- Parallel test execution for legacy and nextgen
- Automated comparison between environments
- Performance regression detection
- Visual regression detection
- Accessibility compliance validation

‚úÖ FAILURE HANDLING:
- Stop all automation on validation failure
- Revert to last known good state
- Document the failure point
- Create targeted fix before continuing
```

## üö® **CRITICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS (Past Attempts)**

### **Failed Approaches to Avoid**
1. **A: Surgical Patch Recovery** - Assumes stable base (false)
2. **C: Nuke to v1.3.2 Snapshot** - Regression risk, still had theme/role debt
3. **Mass AutoRoleView Migration** - 4x rollback failures due to implementation flaws

### **Root Cause: Implementation Strategy Flaws**
- ‚ùå **Mass migration approach** instead of incremental
- ‚ùå **No role analysis** before implementation
- ‚ùå **Missing performance monitoring** and benchmarking
- ‚ùå **Debug system overwhelmed** the UI
- ‚ùå **Poor rollback strategy** and validation

- Performance optimization ongoing
- Dual-mount overhead must be measured

‚ùå AVOID: Ignoring performance implications
- Skipping performance testing
- Assuming AutoRoleView overhead is negligible
- No performance monitoring
```

### **4. Debug Systems Need Controls**
```

## üöÄ **CONCLUSION**

The **B + D + E strategy** combines the best approaches:
- **B**: Clean rebuild from src-reference/ (most defensible)
- **D**: Dual-mount architecture (enables safe testing)
- **E**: Hybrid renderer shell (controlled transition)

This approach **avoids the 4x rollback failures** by:
1. **Incremental migration** - never mass replacement
2. **Performance monitoring** - AutoRoleView overhead is real
3. **Debug controls** - debug systems can overwhelm
4. **Validation gates** - test after every change
5. **Rollback strategy** - plan for failure scenarios
6. **Dual-mount safety** - test nextgen alongside legacy

**The AutoRoleView system itself is sound** - the failure was in the **implementation approach**. With proper incremental migration, role analysis, performance monitoring, and safety measures, src-nextgen/ can be successfully implemented.

**Success depends on following the lessons learned from the 4x rollback failures while leveraging the B + D + E strategy.**
