    "GOAL: Add form state restoration sentinel for dual-mount auth flows",
    "MISSION: Create a sentinel component to catch and restore lost form state in onboarding and dual-mounted authentication flows",
    "CONTEXT: During dual-mount migration, form state can be lost when switching between legacy and nextgen environments. This sentinel ensures form data persistence across environment switches.",
    "SAFETY ENFORCEMENT: Form state must be preserved, restored correctly, and not interfere with authentication flows",
    "STABLE STATE CHECK: Confirm form state restoration working, no data loss, and seamless environment switching"
