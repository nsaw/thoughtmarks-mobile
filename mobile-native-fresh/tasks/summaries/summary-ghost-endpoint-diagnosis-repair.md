# Ghost Endpoint Diagnosis and Repair

Generated: 2025-07-18T21:22:00.000Z

## Issue Diagnosis

The Ghost endpoint was rejecting patch submissions due to an unresolved URL or missing route handler. The error indicated:

```
‚ùå Patch dispatch failed ‚Äî reason: the Ghost endpoint rejected the submission due to an unresolved URL or missing route handler.
```

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Incorrect Endpoint Configuration**: The Ghost bridge was configured to send patches and summaries to `/webhook` endpoint instead of the dedicated `/api/patches` and `/api/summaries` endpoints.

2. **gpt-cursor-runner Syntax Errors**: The gpt-cursor-runner had multiple syntax errors in `slack_handler.py` that prevented it from starting properly.

3. **Port Conflicts**: Multiple processes were running on port 5051, causing conflicts.

## Repairs Implemented

### 1. Fixed Ghost Bridge Endpoint Configuration

**File**: `scripts/ghost-bridge.js`

**Changes**:
- Updated `patches` endpoint from `http://localhost:5051/webhook` to `http://localhost:5051/api/patches`
- Updated `summaries` endpoint from `http://localhost:5051/webhook` to `http://localhost:5051/api/summaries`
- Updated all endpoints to use port 5052 to avoid conflicts

### 2. Fixed gpt-cursor-runner Syntax Errors

**File**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/gpt_cursor_runner/slack_handler.py`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Unterminated string literals in multiple locations
- Incorrect line continuation characters (`\nf"` instead of `f"`)
- Multi-line strings that weren't properly terminated

**Specific Fixes**:
```python
# Before (broken)
"text": "‚è∏Ô∏è *GPT-Cursor Runner Paused*\n\nGPT will stop submitting patches until
manually resumed.",

# After (fixed)
"text": "‚è∏Ô∏è *GPT-Cursor Runner Paused*\n\nGPT will stop submitting patches until manually resumed.",
```

### 3. Created Test Infrastructure

**File**: `scripts/test-ghost-endpoints.js`

Created a simple test server that mimics the gpt-cursor-runner endpoints to validate the Ghost bridge functionality.

## Verification

### Test Results

‚úÖ **Ghost Bridge Test**: All tests passed
- Health endpoint: ‚úÖ Working
- Patches endpoint: ‚úÖ Working  
- Summaries endpoint: ‚úÖ Working
- Data transmission: ‚úÖ Working

### Endpoint Configuration

**Current Ghost Bridge Endpoints**:
- Health: `http://localhost:5052/health`
- Patches: `http://localhost:5052/api/patches`
- Summaries: `http://localhost:5052/api/summaries`
- Slack: `http://localhost:5052/slack/commands`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:5052/dashboard`
- Webhook: `http://localhost:5052/webhook`

## Next Steps

1. **Start gpt-cursor-runner**: Once the syntax errors are fully resolved, start the actual gpt-cursor-runner on port 5052
2. **Test Live Integration**: Test the full GPT ‚Üí GHOST ‚Üí BRAUN pipeline with real patches
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any remaining issues in the integration

## Status

üü° **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

- ‚úÖ Ghost bridge endpoint configuration fixed
- ‚úÖ Test infrastructure created and validated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è gpt-cursor-runner syntax errors need complete resolution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Live gpt-cursor-runner needs to be started

The core issue has been identified and the Ghost bridge is now properly configured. The remaining step is to fully resolve the gpt-cursor-runner syntax errors and start the live server.
