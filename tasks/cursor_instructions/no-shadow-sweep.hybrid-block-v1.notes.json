      "\ud83c\udfaf GOAL: Enforce clean scoping for tokens, styles, and props to avoid shadowing bugs",
      "\ud83d\udccc CONTEXT: Prior token enforcement missed local redeclarations (e.g. `tokens` inside theme functions)",
      "\ud83d\udca5 BUG: Files like variants.ts had multiple `tokens` references that created runtime errors",
