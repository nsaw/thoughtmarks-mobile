    "üß† MISSION: Resume live runtime violation tracing after demo content rehydration triggered ScrollView layout error",
    "üéØ GOAL: Identify which component or render path is causing layout props (e.g., alignItems, justifyContent) to be applied to `style` on <ScrollView>, despite previous clean static passes and JSX tag repair",
    "üìå CONTEXT: App booted cleanly to login screen (checkpoint: v1.4.0_scrollview-final-pre-demo_250701_2323UTC). But once demo content loads and Dashboard mounts, the original error returns:",
    "Invariant Violation: ScrollView child layout ([\"alignItems\",\"justifyContent\"]) must be applied through the contentContainerStyle prop.",
    "üí• BUG: The error stack confirms it occurs inside DebugScrollView itself (line 20), which means it is actively rendering layout props in style that escaped detection during previous static or JSX rewrites",
    "üîß FIX SUMMARY: Use DebugScrollView's `debugId` and runtime logs to trace exactly which instance triggered the error. Review the associated component file and prop resolution logic. Manually patch the affected instance(s) to ensure layout props are placed in contentContainerStyle. Capture file path, style prop, and resolved object in log output.",
    "üîê RELEVANCE: This layout violation is now reproducible and fully traceable at runtime. DebugScrollView is capturing the offending instance. The system is functioning as intended, but still has one or more data-driven layout leaks."
